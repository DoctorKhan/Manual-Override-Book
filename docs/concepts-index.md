## Usage Guidelines

### For Narrative Development
When working on `src_new/` content:

1. **Reference Core Concepts** first to understand fundamental framework
2. **Check Glossary** for precise definitions of terms
3. **Review specific frameworks** (Four Freedoms, Cosmic Rhythm) for detailed understanding
4. **Consult Technologies document** for practical methods to include
5. **Use Metaphysical Framework** for advanced theoretical context

### For Concept Integration
When integrating concepts into new narrative:

1. **Maintain conceptual accuracy** - use precise definitions from glossary
2. **Preserve framework integrity** - don't modify core relationships between concepts
3. **Adapt presentation style** - translate concepts into narrative format appropriate for new structure
4. **Include practical applications** - ensure concepts remain actionable, not just theoretical
5. **Reference source material** - note which original sections concepts came from

### For Content Development
When developing new content:

1. **Build on existing foundation** - extend rather than replace core concepts
2. **Maintain consistency** - use established terminology and frameworks
3. **Add narrative elements** - embed concepts in stories, examples, and character development
4. **Preserve practical value** - ensure concepts remain useful for readers
5. **Document new additions** - update concept docs if new frameworks are developed

## Source Material Mapping

### Original Source Locations
- `src/10_stage_pattern_recognition/` → Core Concepts, Field Research Kit
- `src/20_stage_cosmic_rhythm/` → Cosmic Rhythm Framework, Rubber Hand Revelation
- `src/30_stage_four_freedoms/` → Four Freedoms Framework
- `src/40_stage_multiplanar_integration/` → Metaphysical Framework, Advanced Concepts
- `src/90_appendix/` → Glossary, Comprehensive Definitions

### Content Preservation
All core concepts, frameworks, and practical methods from the original source material have been preserved in these documentation files. The narrative presentation has been extracted while maintaining the conceptual integrity and practical applicability.

## Next Steps

1. **Review concept documents** to understand full scope of original material
2. **Identify key concepts** for integration into new narrative structure
3. **Develop narrative presentations** that embed concepts naturally in story format
4. **Maintain reference links** between new content and concept documentation
5. **Update concept docs** if new frameworks or refinements are developed
