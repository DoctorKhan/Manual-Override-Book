# Manual Override: Complete Glossary

*Comprehensive definitions of key terms from original Manual Override source material*

## Core Concepts

**Akatta (Non-Judgment)**
One of the Four Freedoms. The practice of meeting each moment without comparing it to imagined standards or labeling it as good or bad. Liberation from the suffering of judgment and resistance.

**Ahimsa (Non-Violence/Non-Harm)**
One of the Four Freedoms. Staying present and responding with parental wisdom rather than fighting, fleeing, or freezing. Liberation from unnecessary conflict and reactivity.

**Anatta (Non-Self/Non-Identification)**
One of the Four Freedoms. Recognition that you are not the thing being threatened, judged, or affected - you are the awareness observing the experience. Liberation from taking everything personally.

**Charge**
An energetic pattern in the body-mind that triggers an automatic response. Formed from past experiences and conditioning. In the mental landscape model, charges are points of energetic significance that either attract (positive charge) or repel (negative charge) your attention. Can be understood as un-integrated Parts.

**Choice Point**
The moment between stimulus and response where conscious choice becomes possible. The gap where manual override can occur instead of automatic reaction.

**Cosmic Rhythm**
The natural three-phase cycle of consciousness: Phase 1 (Exploring/Forgetting), Phase 2 (Awakening/Observing), Phase 3 (Merging/Integrating). The fundamental pattern underlying all growth and spiritual development.

**Field Research Kit**
Methodological approach to studying your own consciousness like a scientist - following evidence, distinguishing observation from speculation, testing claims through experimentation, remaining open to being wrong.

**The Glitch**
The recognition that most human decisions are made by automated processes outside conscious awareness. The central mystery that begins the investigation into consciousness.

**Graduated Soul Mentorship System**
Model for understanding spiritual development as collaborative process. Souls who have mastered human incarnation cycle "graduate" and become part of guidance system, providing non-intrusive support.

**Holding a Charge**
The practice of keeping attention on an active charge (strong emotion, desire, aversion) without either acting on it or suppressing it. Core mechanism for integrating charges and liberating contained energy.

**Integration**
The process of weaving insights and capacities gained in practice into everyday life. Involves dissolution of boundary between "spiritual practice" and "real life," and harmonization of internal Parts into cohesive Self.

**Manual Override**
The process by which soul-level consciousness takes direct control, bypassing NPC's automated responses. Achieved through consciously integrating charges via focused, non-identified presence.

**Mental Landscape**
Model for understanding mind as dynamic space filled with positive and negative "charges." Ordinary awareness is passively pulled between charges. Agency is skill of consciously navigating this landscape.

**Metrics Not Goals**
Approach focusing on measuring progress rather than achieving fixed states. Nirvana as cooling metric (something on fire cooling down) rather than destination.

**NPC (Non-Player Character) Consciousness**
Automated, programmed thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that run much of human life. Operates on probabilistic path through mental landscape, reacting to triggers without genuine conscious choice.

**The Observer**
Not a fixed entity, but relational process. Function of awareness that creates space between stimulus and response, allowing conscious choice. The "Observer Trap" is mistaking this function for ultimate identity.

**Parts (Internal Family Systems)**
Model understanding psyche as collection of sub-personalities or "parts." Charges are often functionally equivalent to parts - energetic patterns with their own beliefs, feelings, and history.

**Planes of Existence**
Different, simultaneously existing layers of reality (physical, energetic, mental, intuitive). Brain acts as receiver, typically tuning into only physical plane. Development involves accessing multiple planes.

**Rubber Hand Revelation**
Experiment demonstrating how consciousness moves through identification phases. Shows how focused attention (increased sampling rate) makes any experience feel more "real" and personal.

**Surrender**
Not passive resignation, but conscious, active process. Deepest surrender is to the unconstructed itself. At highest level, involves NPC (character) surrendering to being skillfully played by soul (player).

**Temperature Measurement**
System for tracking consciousness states using cooling metaphor. Hot = reactive/triggered, Cool = spacious awareness, Cold = deep equanimity. Nirvana as cooling metric.

**The Unconstructed**
Baseline state of awareness existing before we project stories, meanings, identities onto it. Silence beneath noise, foundation from which all constructions emerge. Encountering it signals old story has run its course.

**Vector**
Goal reconceived as direction on compass rather than fixed destination. Provides clear direction while allowing flexibility in how journey unfolds, avoiding rigidity of manifestation trap.

**Whirlpool Model**
Framework explaining how emotions create physical "dwell time" that attracts confirming thoughts, creating feedback loops. Three intervention strategies: somatic, cognitive, competitive sensory.

**Wu Wei (Non-Action/Effortless Action)**
One of the Four Freedoms. Art of surrender - letting go of need to control and trusting natural unfolding while remaining present and responsive. Liberation from exhausting effort and attachment.

## The Four Freedoms Framework

**Anatta Check**: "Am I over-identified with this experience?"
**Ahimsa Check**: "Am I in conflict mode?"
**Akatta Check**: "Am I trying to control too much?"
**Wu Wei Check**: "Am I forcing or clinging?"

## Cosmic Rhythm Phases

**Phase 1: Exploring/Forgetting (Playing the Character)**
- Complete identification with experience
- "I AM angry" instead of "character is experiencing anger"
- Functional forgetting ensures full engagement with learning

**Phase 2: Awakening/Observing (Remembering You're the Player)**
- Crack appears in construct through practice, grace, or suffering
- Remember: "I'm the Player who got absorbed in playing character"
- Observer develops capacity to witness without being overwhelmed

**Phase 3: Merging/Integrating (Non-Dual and Integration)**
- Two pathways: Merging (dissolution of duality) or Withdrawal (conscious disidentification)
- Conscious withdrawal of energy from parts/programs
- Operating from choice rather than compulsion

## Parts Work Process

**1. Identify the Part (Anatta)**
- "A part of me feels anxious" vs "I am anxious"
- Creates space between you and the part

**2. Relate to the Part**
- Approach with curiosity and compassion
- Ask what part's job is, what it fears would happen if it stopped

**3. Integrate the Part**
- Help part feel seen and understood
- Consciously withdraw energy from rigid role
- Return valuable qualities to whole system

## Development Stages

**Stage 1: Pattern Recognition**
- Recognizing automated responses and NPC patterns
- Identifying charges and triggers
- Building basic awareness of player vs character

**Stage 2: Observer Development**
- Strengthening capacity to witness without changing
- Creating space between triggers and responses
- Building "observer muscle" through practice

**Stage 3: Choice Point Training**
- Recognizing moment of choice between reaction and response
- Developing skill in pausing at choice points
- Building capacity to hold charges

**Stage 4: Integration Mastery**
- Weaving insights into everyday life
- Dissolving boundary between practice and life
- Operating from dynamic freedom as default

## Practical Applications

**Daily Temperature Check**: Regular assessment of reactivity levels using hot/cool/cold scale

**Four Freedoms Scan**: Quick check of which freedom is needed in challenging situations

**Charge Integration**: Practice of staying present with strong emotions without acting or suppressing

**Vector Navigation**: Setting directions rather than fixed goals, allowing flexibility in approach

**Plane Awareness**: Recognizing which plane (physical, energetic, mental, intuitive) experience is occurring on

**Player-Character Dialogue**: Regular conversations between personality concerns and soul wisdom
