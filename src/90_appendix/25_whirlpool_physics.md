# Appendix: Whirlpool Physics (Debuff Loops) and Three Special Moves

This appendix preserves a practical model from earlier drafts for working with sticky mental-emotional loops.

## Five common loop structures

- Anxiety Spiral (accelerating vectors): fear ↔ catastrophic thoughts
- Depression Vortex (collapsing vectors): withdrawal ↔ low energy
- Rage Cyclone (explosive vectors): pressure ↔ blame → release → guilt
- Obsession Loop (circular vectors): desire/idea → tight attention circuit
- Confusion Cloud (random vectors): overwhelm → scattered, competing pulls

Each loop combines thoughts + emotions + sensations → a single resultant “state vector.”

## Three special moves
1) Haptic Focus (align then guide)

- Stop resisting → map the vector → briefly align (“this energy is here”) → guide toward a useful action

2) Script Analysis (re-compose)

- Identify resultant vector → choose desired direction → add counter-components (movement, connection, reframing) → allow new composition

3) Input Interrupt (transform)

- Identify components → honor function (“what value is this protecting?”) → transform story from blame to principled action → redirect energy

Use these moves with the compass: establish safety/boundary (West), reduce forcing (South), drop labels (East), de-personalize (North).

Tip: Log 3 loops this week. Name type, note vector, try one move, record effect.
