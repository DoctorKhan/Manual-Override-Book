# Glossary of Key Terms

#### Core Concepts

**Manual Override:** The act of consciously choosing your response in a situation where an automatic, programmed reaction would normally take over. It is the core skill of conscious living, moving from being a passenger in your life to being the pilot.

**Autopilot (state):** The default, automated mode of operation where perception, thought, and behavior run on learned programs without conscious choice. In running text, use lowercase “autopilot” (e.g., “on autopilot”).

**NPC (Non-Player Character):** A metaphor for the automated, programmed self. It represents the collection of habits, beliefs, and reactive patterns that operate without conscious choice, running on predictable scripts. This is a description of a process, not a judgment of a person.

**Charge:** A stored pattern of emotional and physical energy in the body-mind, linked to a past experience. When triggered, a charge activates an automatic program (an NPC response). A positive charge creates a compulsion or craving; a negative charge creates an aversion or defense.

**The Player View:** The capacity of consciousness to step back and witness thoughts, feelings, and sensations without identifying with them. It is not a separate "thing," but the function that creates the space necessary for Manual Override. Also called "Player Mode" when referring to the perspective.

**The Four Player Modes:** The natural, four-mode cycle of conscious experience:

- **Mode 0 (Offline Mode):** The Player is AFK - deep sleep where consciousness recharges at the source.
- **Mode 1 (Character-Lock):** Getting lost in the "game" of life, identifying completely with your role and reactions.
- **Mode 2 (Lucid Mode):** The **Player View** emerging, realizing you are not your thoughts or feelings.
- **Mode 3 (Flow Mode, a.k.a. God Mode):** Consciously choosing to re-engage with life, playing your role with skill and presence without losing the perspective that it is a role.

**Debuff Loop:** A self-sustaining feedback cycle where a thought creates a feeling, and the feeling reinforces the thought, locking you into a subjective reality (e.g., an "anxiety loop" or an "anger loop"). Manual Override involves breaking this loop. Also called **Stun-Lock** when it prevents other actions.

**Character-Lock:** The state of being completely identified with your in-game avatar (personality/body), forgetting you are the Player. This is the default gameplay mode that creates immersion.

**The Player:** The core consciousness that is playing the game of life. Not the character/avatar, but the awareness in which the character appears.

**Challenge Difficulty:** The raw intensity of a difficult situation, equivalent to what the Character experiences as "pain" but is actually the game's mechanism for offering XP.

**XP (Experience Points):** The growth and wisdom gained from successfully navigating challenges while maintaining Player awareness.

> Terminology note (consistency across the book):
> - Use “autopilot” for the state you’re in (e.g., “I was on autopilot”).
> - Use “the NPC” for the mechanism/program that runs behavior while on autopilot (e.g., “an NPC pattern,” “the NPC program”).
> - Use “Player” for conscious awareness/agency (“the Player View”).
> - “AI” refers only to the in-story AI research characters, not the autopilot mechanism.
> - The word “robot” may appear as a metaphor in narrative passages, but prefer “autopilot”/“NPC” elsewhere.

#### Advanced Concepts

**The Four Freedoms:** An advanced navigation system for consciousness. They are four qualities of awareness you can apply to challenging situations:

- **Non-Identification:** Realizing you are not the thought, emotion, or role being threatened.
- **Non-Violence:** Responding to conflict with calm, parental wisdom instead of fight-or-flight.
- **Non-Action:** Doing your part skillfully without taking on the burden of controlling all outcomes.
- **Non-Judgment:** Flowing with what's emerging naturally instead of forcing a specific result.

**The Consciousness Interface:** The model proposing that the brain does not create consciousness, but acts as a sophisticated receiver or "interface" that tunes into a broader field of consciousness. Manual Override is the skill of learning to operate this interface consciously.

**The Manifestation Trap:** The common spiritual distortion where consciousness techniques are used by the ego to try and control reality and acquire things, rather than to develop wisdom and presence. It is a sophisticated form of spiritual materialism that reinforces the ego instead of liberating you from it.
