# Glossary of Key Terms

## Core Concepts

**Manual Override:** The act of consciously choosing your response in a situation where an automatic, programmed reaction would normally take over. It is the core skill of conscious living, moving from being a passenger in your life to being the pilot.

**NPC (Non-Player Character):** A metaphor for the automated, programmed self. It represents the collection of habits, beliefs, and reactive patterns that operate without conscious choice, running on predictable scripts. This is a description of a process, not a judgment of a person.

**Charge:** A stored pattern of emotional and physical energy in the body-mind, linked to a past experience. When triggered, a charge activates an automatic program (an NPC response). A positive charge creates a compulsion or craving; a negative charge creates an aversion or defense.

**The Observer:** The capacity of consciousness to step back and witness thoughts, feelings, and sensations without identifying with them. It is not a separate "thing," but the function that creates the space necessary for Manual Override.

**The Cosmic Rhythm:** The natural, three-phase cycle of conscious experience:
- **Phase 1 (Total Immersion):** Getting lost in the "game" of life, identifying completely with your role and reactions.
- **Phase 2 (Awakening):** The "Observer" emerging, realizing you are not your thoughts or feelings.
- **Phase 3 (The Player's Mindset):** Consciously choosing to re-engage with life, playing your role with skill and presence without losing the perspective that it is a role.

**The Reality Whirlpool:** A self-sustaining feedback loop where a thought creates a feeling, and the feeling reinforces the thought, locking you into a subjective reality (e.g., an "anxiety whirlpool" or an "anger whirlpool"). Manual Override involves breaking this loop.

## Advanced Concepts

**The Four Freedoms:** An advanced navigation system for consciousness. They are four qualities of awareness you can apply to challenging situations:
- **Anatta (Non-Identification):** Realizing you are not the thought, emotion, or role being threatened.
- **Ahimsa (Non-Harm):** Responding to conflict with calm, parental wisdom instead of fight-or-flight.
- **Akatta (Non-Doership):** Doing your part skillfully without taking on the burden of controlling all outcomes.
- **Wu Wei (Effortless Action):** Flowing with what's emerging naturally instead of forcing a specific result.

**The Consciousness Interface:** The model proposing that the brain does not create consciousness, but acts as a sophisticated receiver or "interface" that tunes into a broader field of consciousness. Manual Override is the skill of learning to operate this interface consciously.

**The Manifestation Trap:** The common spiritual distortion where consciousness techniques are used by the ego to try and control reality and acquire things, rather than to develop wisdom and presence. It is a sophisticated form of spiritual materialism that reinforces the ego instead of liberating you from it.
