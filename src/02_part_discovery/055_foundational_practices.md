# Chapter 5.5: Foundational Practices (The Three Streams)

To make the frameworks usable in real life, you need a base practice that stabilizes attention and embodiment.

## The Three Streams

- Thought stream: label “thinking,” return to breath
- Feeling stream: locate raw sensation, breathe into it
- Sensation stream: body scan; feet/seat as anchors

## Daily mini-regimen (10 minutes)

- 3 breaths to arrive
- 5 minutes breath + “thinking” label
- 5 minutes body scan; mark two areas of tension
- Set intention: “Notice the space between stimulus and response.”

## Micro-resets (2 minutes)

- Pause → 3 breaths → feel feet → ask: “What’s actually required now?”

## Troubleshooting

- Busy mind is okay: goal is not fewer thoughts, but less belief
- No time: link resets to transitions (before email, after meetings)
- Boredom: progress indicator is how you handle real-world triggers

This chapter preserves core training from earlier drafts so the compass and gateway have a stable base.
