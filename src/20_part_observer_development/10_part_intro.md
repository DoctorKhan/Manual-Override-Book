## Part 2: Observer Development
Most people believe they are constantly doing, acting, and making choicesâ€”while meditation is seen as 'doing nothing.' In reality, for many, meditation is the only time they are actually doing anything at all. The rest of life is often spent running automatic programs, while meditation is the rare moment of conscious participation.

But what is meditation, really? At its core, it is about directly observing what is happening in the moment. And though this may seem passive, it is the essential first step: learning to see clearly, without interference, before any real change or agency is possible.

Each moment of direct observation is another step toward freedom. By seeing clearly, you begin to loosen the grip of automatic patterns and reclaim the possibility of conscious choice.
