# The Automated Life

I couldn't stop thinking about Dr. Rodriguez's research. 797 out of 847 decisions made by something other than conscious awareness. The number haunted me.

I decided to conduct my own experiment. For one week, I would pay attention to my choices—really pay attention. I would catch myself in the act of deciding and ask: *Did I actually choose this, or did it just happen?*

The results were more disturbing than I'd expected.

## The Evidence Accumulates

By day three of my experiment, I had filled pages with observations. The patterns were undeniable, and they fell into clear categories that painted a picture of human behavior far more automated than I'd ever imagined.

##### Category 1: The Repetition Patterns

**The Same Mistakes, Over and Over**

I started noticing something unsettling: people around me made the same mistakes repeatedly, as if they were following a script they couldn't see.

My colleague Mark always got triggered by the same type of feedback, reacting defensively every single time. My friend Lisa had been promising to start exercising "next Monday" for six months, but never followed through. My own parents had the same argument about money with identical words, escalation patterns, and unresolved endings.

Most disturbing was recognizing my own patterns. The way I always checked my phone when feeling anxious. The route I took to work even when traffic was terrible. The defensive tone that automatically emerged when my partner brought up certain topics.

**The Research Confirms It:**

- Studies show that 40-45% of daily behaviors are habits, not conscious decisions
- People make approximately 35,000 decisions per day, but most follow predictable patterns
- Neuroimaging reveals that habitual behaviors activate different brain regions than conscious choices
- The "planning fallacy" shows people consistently make the same estimation errors despite repeated experience

##### Category 2: The Trigger-Response Mechanism

I began mapping my own responses to specific stimuli. The precision was disturbing.

**Exhibit A:** The notification sound that immediately pulled my attention away from whatever I was doing—regardless of how important my current task was.

**Exhibit B:** My partner's particular tone of voice that instantly created defensiveness in me—even when his actual words were neutral.

**Exhibit C:** The sight of certain foods that triggered automatic eating—completely independent of whether I was actually hungry.

**Exhibit D:** Specific situations that reliably produced anxiety, anger, or other emotional states—with timing so predictable I could set a clock by it.

This wasn't just similarity—it was near-identical responses, as if I was running the same program with minimal variation. The question became: if these responses were so automatic, what was actually generating them?

##### Category 3: The Awareness Gaps

Perhaps the most compelling evidence was what I didn't remember about my own behavior.

I drove to work one morning and realized I couldn't remember the journey. I'd eaten an entire lunch while scrolling my phone with no memory of tasting the food. During conversations, I found myself planning responses instead of listening, then couldn't remember what the other person had said.

Most unsettling: I checked my phone dozens of times per day without any conscious decision to do so.

These weren't isolated incidents of distraction. They represented systematic gaps in conscious awareness during routine activities. It was as if something else was operating the controls while my conscious awareness was... elsewhere.

##### Category 4: The Choice Illusion

The most disturbing evidence came from examining what I called my "choices." Many decisions that felt conscious and deliberate were actually the result of factors I wasn't aware of.

**Environmental Programming:**

- I bought more when stores played slower music
- My mood affected my food choices in predictable ways
- My political opinions had been shaped by my social media algorithm
- Even my "spontaneous" weekend activities followed patterns based on weather, energy levels, and social cues

**Social Programming:**

- My fashion choices clustered around what my peer group wore
- My opinions on controversial topics aligned suspiciously with my social circle
- I found myself conforming to group behavior even when I disagreed
- My lifestyle choices followed predictable demographic patterns

**Biological Programming:**

- My decision-making changed based on hormonal cycles
- Low blood sugar made me irritable and impulsive
- Sleep deprivation systematically altered my risk assessment
- Even my personality traits seemed to follow genetic patterns I'd inherited

How many of my "choices" were actually chosen?

##### Category 5: The Reflex Deception

I discovered research that shattered my remaining illusions about conscious choice:

**The Startle Response Study:** Researchers had participants hold their hand over a button. At random intervals, a loud noise would startle them, causing an automatic reflex to press the button. Participants consistently reported that they "decided" to press the button, even though the action was purely reflexive.

**The Choice Blindness Experiments:** People were asked to choose between two options. Through sleight of hand, researchers gave them the option they didn't choose. Most people not only failed to notice the switch but confidently explained why they had "chosen" the option they actually rejected.

**The Libet Experiments:** Brain activity indicating a decision begins several hundred milliseconds before people report being aware of their intention to act. We are constantly making "decisions" that we then experience as conscious choices, even though the choice was made by unconscious processes.

The implication was staggering: my sense of being the conscious author of my actions was largely a post-hoc story my brain told me. I experienced automatic responses as conscious decisions, then created rational explanations for choices I never actually made.

##### Category 6: The Resistance to Change

If people were truly in conscious control of their behavior, self-improvement would be straightforward: identify what you want to change, decide to change it, and implement the change. But my own experience told a different story:

- 92% of New Year's resolutions fail
- Most people regain lost weight within 2-5 years
- Addiction recovery has high relapse rates even with strong motivation
- Therapy often takes years to produce lasting behavioral change

What was particularly telling was how the resistance to change operated in my own life. It wasn't just that change was difficult—something seemed to actively oppose change, creating elaborate justifications for returning to old patterns.

I thought about my own failed attempts at meditation, exercise, and healthier eating. The elaborate stories I'd tell myself about why "now wasn't the right time" or why the old way was "actually better."

## The Disturbing Questions

By the end of my week-long experiment, I was left with questions that kept me awake at night:

1. **How much of what we call "choice" is actually automatic programming?**
2. **What is making decisions when we're not consciously aware of deciding?**
3. **If there's an observer that can step back from automatic behavior, why isn't it active more often?**
4. **Are we actually living our lives, or are our lives living us?**

The automation evidence was disturbing enough, but it raised an even more unsettling question: if something else was making most of my decisions, what was that something? And why did it occasionally seem to step back, allowing moments of genuine choice to emerge?

## A Glimmer of Hope

But there was one category of evidence that offered hope. I had begun to notice something I called "The Observer Phenomenon."

Occasionally, I would experience stepping back from my own behavior and observing it as if from outside:

- Watching myself get angry and thinking, "Why am I reacting this way?"
- Noticing myself scrolling social media and wondering, "How did I end up here?"
- Observing my own thoughts and realizing, "I didn't choose to think about this"
- Catching myself in the middle of a habitual behavior and feeling surprised by it

These moments suggested that there was something in human consciousness that could observe the automatic patterns without being caught in them. But if this observer existed, what was it? And why was it usually absent during routine behavior?

I was about to discover that this observer wasn't just a psychological curiosity—it was the key to everything. And some people seemed to have figured out how to access it consistently.

The mystery deepened when I started noticing something else: certain people seemed to operate from this observer state more often than others. They had a quality that was hard to define but impossible to ignore.

I was about to investigate the phenomenon of charisma—and discover that it might hold the secret to conscious living.

## The Research Confirms It

My discoveries in my own life were not unique; they were a reflection of well-documented patterns in human behavior that researchers had observed for decades. The feeling of being on autopilot wasn't just a feeling—it was a measurable reality.

**Habitual Behavior:** Studies from institutions like Duke University have shown that up to **45% of our daily behaviors are not conscious decisions, but habits** performed automatically in familiar settings. These behaviors are so deeply ingrained that they activate different neural pathways than conscious decision-making, essentially running on a separate operating system in the brain.

**Decision Fatigue:** While estimates vary, researchers suggest people make approximately 35,000 remotely conscious decisions per day. The sheer volume ensures the vast majority must follow predictable, pre-programmed neural pathways to conserve energy. This is why even highly intelligent people make poor decisions when mentally exhausted—the conscious decision-making system simply runs out of fuel.

**Cognitive Biases:** The "planning fallacy," a well-documented cognitive bias first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, shows that people consistently and predictably underestimate the time it will take to complete a task, even when they have direct experience of failing to meet similar deadlines in the past. This is a clear sign of automated, optimistic programming overriding direct experience.

**The Intention-Action Gap:** The staggering **92% failure rate of New Year's resolutions** highlights the immense power of automated programming over conscious intention. Our autopilot is simply more powerful than our fleeting moments of resolve. This isn't a failure of willpower—it's evidence that something else is running the show most of the time.

**Priming Effects:** Studies show that people's behavior can be unconsciously influenced by subtle environmental cues. Participants exposed to words related to elderly stereotypes walked more slowly afterward, without any awareness of the connection. This suggests that much of what we experience as "choice" is actually environmental programming operating below the threshold of consciousness.

## The Ghost in the Machine: The Player and the Autopilot

*Consider the actor who plays King Lear so convincingly that he forgets he is not the king. The tragedy is not that he plays the role, but that he has forgotten he is the actor.*

Our investigation reveals a fundamental truth of the human condition: you are not a single, unified being. You are a composite. You are a **Player**—an eternal, conscious Soul—operating a sophisticated biological avatar. This avatar often runs on **Autopilot**, a complex **Operating System (OS)** of programmed thoughts, emotions, and habits.

**The Character's OS:** Is the product of genetics, culture, and trauma. Its prime directive is survival and pattern-matching. It is deterministic and predictable.

**The Player's Soul:** Is the source of true consciousness, free will, and agentic choice. Its prime directive is growth and integration.

**There is no conflict here, only a distinction.** The Autopilot is not your enemy; it is the vehicle. The "Fall" was not a moral error; it was the moment the game's difficulty was increased by giving the OS more autonomy. **Free will is not a debate; it is a technical reality. It is the Player's ability to override the Character's default programming.** This book is the user manual for that process.

### ⚠️ The Prime Directive of the Player/Autopilot Model

The term "Autopilot" is a functional metaphor, not a judgment. To use this framework without falling into the trap of spiritual ego, you must adhere to this prime directive:

1. **It Describes a Process, Not a Person:** **"Autopilot" refers to the automated programming** running within a person—including yourself. It is a temporary state of being, not a type of person.

2. **Everyone runs on Autopilot most of the time:** The automated self is the default human condition. The most advanced spiritual master still operates on autopilot while tying their shoes or driving a familiar road. The goal is not to eliminate the Autopilot, but to develop the skill of "Manual Override."

3. **Always See the Player Behind the Programming:** This is the most crucial point. **The central act of compassion and wisdom in this framework is to always acknowledge the eternal Soul, the true Player, that exists behind every automated script.** Just as you know a human player is controlling a video game character, your work is to remember that a divine Player is experiencing life through the human being in front of you, regardless of how their programming may appear in that moment.

To feel superior to someone running on Autopilot is as illogical as a conscious pilot feeling superior to a plane flying itself on a pre-set course. It misses the entire point. The plane is not your opponent; the other *pilot* is your equal. Your task is to see that other Player with respect, always.

The evidence was overwhelming: human beings operate on autopilot far more than anyone had previously imagined. But this raised the crucial question that would drive my investigation forward: if we're not making most of our decisions, what is? And more importantly, can we learn to access the observer that occasionally steps back from these patterns?

That investigation would lead me to the most mysterious phenomenon of all: the people who seemed to have cracked the code.
