### The Larger-Frame Protocol (60–90 seconds)

A secular micro-practice to break whirlpools by widening the frame—no metaphysics required.

1) Pause: Two slow exhales to downshift
2) Name the loop: “This is a status/control/certainty loop.”
3) Widen: Say (silently): “There is always a larger frame than this loop.”
4) Choose one greater reference (secular): service, beauty, long‑term values, future self, community, the whole system
5) Feel it: Let the body register wideness (chest softening, gaze broadening)
6) Smallest wise step: From the larger frame, pick a single concrete next action
7) Close: One grateful breath; proceed

Notes

- Do not suppress emotion—include it in the wider frame
- If overwhelm rises: ground (feet, room scan), shorten, retry
- If rumination returns: pair with the 3‑breath Observer reset (see Chapter: The Observer Anomaly)

Why it helps

- Widening reduces threat appraisal, de‑escalates stress chemistry, improves HRV
- Frame-shift reopens choice architecture; skillful action becomes available

#### Deep Protocol (20–30 minutes)

- Setup: Quiet space; optional journal. Set a 25-minute timer.
- Step 1 — Map the Loop (3 min): Name thoughts/emotions/sensations; write one line each.
- Step 2 — Value Anchor (3 min): Identify one greater reference (service, beauty, long-term value, future self, community, whole system). Write one sentence of why it matters to you.
- Step 3 — Somatic Widening (5 min): Breath downshifts; soften chest; broaden gaze; feel space behind/around the body; include the loop in the widened field.
- Step 4 — Reframe (5 min): From the wider frame, write 3 “true and kind” statements that do not deny the loop and 1 principle that will guide action.
- Step 5 — Choice Architecture (5 min): List 3 smallest wise next steps; choose 1 and calendar it.
- Step 6 — Close (2–3 min): One grateful breath; thank the part that tried to protect you; commit to the single next step.

Tip: If the loop resists widening, alternate 30s widen / 30s focus on one neutral external sensory stream (ambient sound) for 3 minutes, then resume.


#### Tool Selection — When to Use Which

- Use Larger-Frame when: you’re stuck in a status/control/certainty whirlpool and perspective has collapsed. Goal: widen and take one wise next step.
- Use Observer reset when: you can’t access perspective at all and feel fused with the reaction. Goal: shift identity from character to Player for 3 breaths.
- Use Three Special Moves when: you can analyze the loop’s components and want to transform its energy (Align/Compose/Transform).

Quick picks

- High heat, little clarity → Observer reset → Larger-Frame
- Medium heat, ruminating → Larger-Frame → Choose action
- Analytical mood, time available → Three Special Moves
